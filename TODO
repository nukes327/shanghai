No longer crashes if there's no config present,
instead prompts user for data to write to the file

On the downside, this means that it crashes if there is a config present that is in the wrong format
Probably need to make the config something specific so it's easier to catch errors like that

See what can be done about cleaning up parsing
Kludgy code to ignore messages from jtv, fix that
